## Data Collation
For the Dataset Collation part, since I'm making use of ultrasound datasets and mammogram dataset, I'm figuring out a way to prepare the dataset and then upload to huggingface. Currently, I have collated datasets for the ultrasounds from two sources, and preparations for the dataset would be carried out, after which we would be combining it have it is properly prepared.

**Ultrasound Dataset Sources**: 
- Rodrigues, Paulo Sergio (2017), “Breast Ultrasound Image”, Mendeley Data, V1, doi: 10.17632/wmy84gzngw.1
- Al-Dhabyani W, Gomaa M, Khaled H, Fahmy A. Dataset of breast ultrasound images. Data in Brief. 2020 Feb;28:104863. DOI: 10.1016/j.dib.2019.104863.

**Mammogram Dataset Source**:
- Pham, H. H., Nguyen Trung, H., & Nguyen, H. Q. (2022). VinDr-Mammo: A large-scale benchmark dataset for computer-aided detection and diagnosis in full-field digital mammography (version 1.0.0). PhysioNet. https://doi.org/10.13026/br2v-7517. Got the processed dataset from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ssmann/vindr-mammo-dataset/data?select=Processed_Images)
